/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/
1. It's worthwhile to play the Sokoban game for yourself. Concepts like "not being able to pull on a box" are much easier to understand when it's visualized.
2. Make sure you have a simple but working version of the alternate heuristic before you try implementing something more complex. Don't forget that your alternate heuristic should perform just as well as the Manhattan heuristic, if not better.
3. Try to read through, or at least skim, the code that's provided to you. You should have a good idea of the functions' return value(s) to make sure you know how to use the return value(s) in your own implementation.
